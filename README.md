# q2-adapative-branching
Quarter 2 Project for the TJHSST ML 1 class. Completed by Leah Zhang and Victoria Zhang. The project investigates a novel constrained optimization approach to optimizing decision trees against overfitting, testing the additional search metaheuristics of simulated annealing and differential equation gradients on improving this novel model.
